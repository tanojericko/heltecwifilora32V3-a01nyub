# Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V3) and A01NYUB Ultra Sonic Sensor code

Made a code to connect Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V3) to A01NYUB Ultra Sonic Sensor code using the code from DFRobot. Through ChatGPT and Assisted prompts, I made the sensor to be responsive to immediate distance changes.  

GPIO 47 and 48 was used to connect the sensor
